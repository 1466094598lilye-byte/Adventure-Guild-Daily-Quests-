# 🧙‍♂️ ✨ Adventurer’s Guild – Daily Quests
Make productivity fun! Turn your tasks into quests, earn loot for staying on track, and keep your streak alive as you level up in the Adventurer’s Guild. Every time you complete a task, your AI guildmates cheer you on—celebrating your wins and keeping you motivated.

## 🚀 Features
🎯 Turn tasks into RPG-style quests
Ordinary to-dos become immersive quests with themed descriptions, icons, and progression.

🪙 Earn loot and rewards
Stay consistent and unlock treasure—because checking off tasks should feel fun.

🔥 AI-powered guild praise (“夸夸包”)
Whenever you finish a quest, AI guild members hype you up with personalized encouragement, making productivity feel like a supportive adventure party experience.

* Assigns them across days
* Inserts them into your daily quest boards
A huge time-saver for planning big projects.
